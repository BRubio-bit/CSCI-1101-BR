        <!--This is a paragraph-->
        <p>
            My name is Braulio Rubio. I am a 22 year old Computer Science student studying at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. (UTRGV) I prefer to be private about what I do, but I also love to talk and meet with new people. I love learning new things and<br>learning about other people! I enjoy playing video games, playing the piano, going for night drives, going out with friends, and listening to music. I'm also an audiophile!</br>

        <h1 style="color:rgb(33, 145, 48)">My reasons for listening to high resolution audio:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Music streaming apps all cost around the same per month, so might as well look for which offeres the most</li>
            <li>I have decent headphones and speakrs, so they're able to handle CD quality and higher</li>
            <li>Spotify charges around $10 for MP3 files while apps like Tidal charge around the same for FLAC files (uncompressed audio)</li>
            <li>I love getting the most out of the stuff I spend money on</li>
          </ul>  
        <!---Added Information-->
        <h1 style="color:rgb(33, 145, 48)">Where I get my music:</h1>
        <ls>Some CDs in the picture don't have covers. That's because I either lost them and burnt the ripped version or I bought them from Qobuz. Qobuz is a music streaming service that streams high resolution music. You can also legally buy music from their app or website. I simply make physical copies of my music because CDs have good sound quality and I love physical media. </ls>
        <p>Link to Qobuz: <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/audio-quality">Qobuz.com</a></p>
